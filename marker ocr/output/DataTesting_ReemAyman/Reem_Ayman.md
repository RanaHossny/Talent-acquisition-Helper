### Projects

Finding Donors in MLCharity - Personal **Project**
Python - Machine Learning *Project* Dec 2022
•Trained the model using different classification algorithms.

•Tuned the model hyperparameters using the grid search which improved its performance in terms of accuracy and F-score.

### The Matrix: Escaped - Academic **Project**

Java - Artificial Intelligence *Project* Nov 2021 - Dec 2021
•Aimed to find the path for the main character Neo to rescue all the hostages and escape to the telephone booth before the agents kill Neo or Neo dies with six different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, uniform cost, greedy, and A*) with two different heuristics.

•Reduced the RAM usage, CPU utilization, and taken time with averages of 2.5%, 5%, and 41.4%
respectively (comparing BFS and A*).
