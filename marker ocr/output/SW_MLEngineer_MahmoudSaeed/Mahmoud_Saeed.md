## Experience

AUGUST 2023 PRESENT
Data Track Headway Program (Data science & ML) | Giza Systems.

- Implemented point anomaly detection algorithms to identify outliers in the dataset, enhancing data quality and ensuring the reliability of analytics results
- Resolved critical issues in the ETL pipeline using Apache NiFi, ensuring seamless data flow and minimizing downtime.

- Updated and optimized the pipeline for asset group management, incorporating features for efficient asset group deletion and addition.

- Used automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to optimize model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### June 2022 - July 2022

Data Science and Business Analytics virtual internship| The Sparks foundation.

- **I have used Python for making cleaning, exploratory, and making deep analysis of data.** 
- Also used Sklearn for Kmean-cluster, Linear Regression, and Decision tree. - **Used NLP to predict sentiment Using Random Forest Classifier and nltk.**
