# Education

B.S. in computer and communication engineering (2020), 
University of Alexandria, Faculty of Engineering.

➢ Grade: **"3.13", "84.77%", "Very Good".** ➢ Job title: **Software engineer Machine learning.**

# Skills

➢ **Software engineering:**
- I'm a Python expert with 6+ years of experience, focusing on writing clean, efficient code for high-traffic applications. Experienced in Django, I develop scalable web apps, including real-time chat services using Django Channels and Redis, I've got experience using Airflow to schedule and manage tasks like sending emails and SMS messages, I'm skilled in deploying apps on AWS, using technologies like Elastic Beanstalk and ECS with load balancers. My toolkit includes Celery, Docker, Redis, Selenium for testing, and front-end technologies. I also work with MySQL, Neo4J, and Git.

➢ **Analytics Platforms:**
- I've also enhanced my skills with Alteryx, earning three certifications: Machine Learning Fundamentals Micro-Credential, Alteryx Foundational Micro-Credential, and Alteryx Designer Core Certification. This has strengthened my ability to analyze data, build models, and automate data processes.

➢ **Data Science:**
- With a solid grasp of machine learning tools (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch), I've deployed projects (e.g., LipSync, FaceSwapping) on AWS. I understand machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and NLP, and apply statistics for data analysis and visualization.

### ➢ Cloud Architecture:

- I manage AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, ECS) to build secure, scalable cloud solutions. My expertise includes cloud security and CI/CD pipelines, enhancing project deployment and management.

○
➢ **Agile:**
- I use Agile methods to improve software development processes, utilizing Jira and Clickup, and Azure DevOps for project management and focusing on functional product design.

# Experiences

➢ Sr. Software engineer machine learning - **GizaSystems** *[May 2023 –Present]* 

### ➢ Jr. Software Engineer - Rightshero [Aug 2022 - March 2023]

- Machine Learning Projects: I contributed to building automated forecasting models that predict future trends based on past data. This involved using machine learning tools and techniques to make our projects smarter and more predictive. 

- Chatbot Development: I led the development of a virtual assistant - chatbot , 
making it possible for users to interact with an AI avatar. This project was all about making technology more accessible and engaging for users, allowing them to get answers from the avatar in real-time. 

- Improving Code Quality: I worked on updating and fixing older Django code to make it better and more efficient. This task was about making sure our software can grow and improve over time without running into problems because of outdated code. 

- Collaboration: Working together with my team, I helped integrate machine learning solutions into our projects, ensuring that we could use our technical insights to make real-world applications better.

- I developed web apps using Django, Flask, and Laravel, streamlined legacy code, and optimized databases for high traffic. I enhanced cloud architecture with AWS, creating microservices, automating CI/CD, and managing deployments with Elastic Beanstalk and ECS. My work included setting up mail services, handling high traffic with load balancers, and monitoring with Elasticsearch/CloudWatch. In data science, I led a digital media project, from data collection with web scraping to analysis with pandas and seaborn. I deployed predictive models using Flask, ensuring robustness and scalability. 

➢ Jr. Data scientist - **SilkBytes** [March 2021 - *March 2023]* 
- Created and investigated various ML models and cutting-edge models ( Lip Sync, Face Swapping, StyleGAN, and so on.) 
- Using real-time machine learning models, I built a video chat platform with Django channels and extensive features. 

- Different cloud architectures for deployment were developed based on the model's resource requirements (CPU, GPU, Memory usage, Exec time).
